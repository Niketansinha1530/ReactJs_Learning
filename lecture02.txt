for using react we need node.js in our environment.

create react project
 npx create-react-app 01basicreact and press enter.//take longer time for installation.

node package executer and create-react-app is a software or utility

recommended is vite and Parcel.

to enter inside 01basicreact write cd 01basicreact.
now check package.json file is shown or not write dir to check.

good way to read any project related to react start with package.json file.

how to run react file

npm run start (package.json file may likha hua hai.)

in norml react project build folder not present to get build folder write npm run build.

in build folder all react  file convert into js and shown inside build folder.

create-react-app is not a good way it is too bulky take longer time to start project so now we vite.

Documentation =https://vitejs.dev/guide/  (to go  back in folder use  cd ..);

start creating project with vite write this
*************************
npm create vite@latest;
*************************

after this console ask for name give name 01vitereact.

then console ask for choose framework now choose React framework and then after console again ask for variant then you choose JavaScript.
in vite project their is no node_modules folder

to enter inside 01vitereact enter cd 01vitereact.
to install node_modules write npm install

to run vitereact write 
npm run dev.

most of time present inside src folder

in 01vitereact enter inside src now delete assets.

now we have only to file 
1. App.jsx
2. main.jsx

content inside App.jsx
(
    function App() {
 
  return (
   <h1>Hell React || Niketan Sinha</h1>
  )
}

export default App
)

content inside main.jsx
(
    import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'


ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)

)

entry point in react is main.jsx.

<> </> this is known as fragment.

file name always in uppercase so working go smooth.
